This report details an in-depth analysis of the cyberattack on Smart Meter Co., an IIoT energy provider, resulting in a sensitive data breach.

Key Activities:

  1. ISMS Framework: Applied the Information Security Management System (ISMS) to manage and evaluate the organization's security posture during the breach.
  2. Cyber Kill Chain: Leveraged the Cyber Kill Chain framework to deconstruct each stage of the attack, enabling a systematic understanding of the adversary's tactics.
  3. Root Cause Analysis: Conducted a thorough root cause analysis to identify the vulnerabilities and security lapses that allowed the breach to occur.
  4. NIST SP 800-53R5 Compliance: Identified and mapped the failed security control families using NIST SP 800-53R5 to highlight areas for future improvement in the organizationâ€™s defense mechanisms.

This project showcases my ability to apply industry-standard security frameworks to analyze cyber incidents and recommend actionable improvements.
