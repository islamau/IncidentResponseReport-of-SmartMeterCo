This report analyzes the cyberattack faced by Smart Meter Co, which resulted in a sensitive data breach. In the course of my research and development of this report, I applied the Information Security Management System (ISMS) framework and leveraged the Cyber Kill Chain to break down each phase of the attack. I also conducted a thorough root cause analysis to identify the underlying factors that led to the incident. Additionally, I effectively used the NIST SP 800-53R5 standard to pinpoint the specific control families that failed during the breach.
